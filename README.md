# raspicluster
Step-by-step tutorial on installation and execution of Raspberry Pi videography  

Raspicluster is an open sourced repository replicating the [PiRATeMC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453577v2.full) videography system with additional coding and instructional updates.
This is specifically a cluster (```cssh```) and not a standalone (```ssh```) design.

This tutorial will thouroughly walk you through the necessary steps to install Ubuntu and rpi imager, program the remote and Raspberry Pies (RPi),
and how to begin taking videos in a synchronized fashion. There is also many files providing a list of products we had ustilized in our design ([product_list](https://github.com/George-LabX/raspicluster/blob/main/product_list.md)) assistance with the raspivid function ([raspivid_help](https://github.com/George-LabX/raspicluster/blob/main/raspivid_help.md)), and a breakdown of often used codes in the Ubuntu/Linux terminal ([terminal_help](https://github.com/George-LabX/raspicluster/blob/main/terminal_help.md)) that can equip you to learn quickly and even create and edit codes to your preferences.  

Please follow the numbered steps below found in the tutorial folder to move through the setup without any obstacles. First we will show you how to install Ubuntu and RPi imager on your device, programming the remote (PC) to act as a controller in conjuction with the switchboard, programming the RPis, and then seeing them in action.
